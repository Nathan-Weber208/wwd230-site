Principle 1:Alignment
</h1>
<p class="dp-alignment">
Alignment is a principle that is never appreciated
  but is infuriating when seen done wrong. Alignment
  is when your elements on your webpage line up, 
  have good spacing, and don't overlap.
</br>
</br>
  Look at In-and-Out's website to the right. You 
  see it plainly in the images below but even in 
  the floating text boxes they are justified and 
  in conformity. When your eye looks over it, you
  are not annoyed by a 10 pixel difference in
  hight or width.

    width="100%"

    alt="In-and-Out"

<h1 class ="dp-whitespace-title">
        Principle 2:Whitespace
    </h1>
    <p class="dp-whitespace">
    The principle of Whitespace is exactly what it
     sounds like. Whitespace (or any background color)
     is used to make your information look more 
     important.
    </br>
    </br>
      Look at McDonald's homepage to the left. Here they
      use whitespace to show this new coupon for fries. 
      they could have used that room for advertizing or 
      for something else. it really could have been 
      anything they are a multi-billion dollar company.
      Instead its blank so our attention is not pulled
      from what they want us to see.

    <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us.html">McDonald's Homepage</a>
    
    </p>
    <img
        class="dp-2nd-img"
        width="100%"
        src="Images\whitespace.jpg"
        alt="McDonald's"
        />


<h1 class ="dp-hickslaw-title">
    Principle 3:Hick's Law
</h1>
<p class="dp-hickslaw">
Hick's Law is a simple design principle that is easy to
 follow. Don't give the user too many options. Your webpage
 should not look like a cockpit with buttons and toggles 
 everywhere. Rather give the user a very straight-forward 
 path as not to be confused.
</br>
</br>
Doorzza's example is a comical extreme. When you load up 
 the webpage you are shown your choice: "Order Now" There
 is no other reason for you to look up this site. Sure if 
 you scroll around you'll find some more options but the 
 intended path is clear.
